Slam Source Code Using Slam Toolbox

The source code was produced in the ros2 foxy.
## How to use

git clone in the src folder of your workspace file

Shell files should be placed outside the src

if you don't have beagle(robomation - korea), change lidar.py code and beagle.py. 

Code runs automatically when you run the start.sh file. You don't have to be surprised because a lot of terminals will be running.

TF_TRANSFROMTAION - tf_transformation is not available on ros2, so use another package to use tf_transformation at tf2
